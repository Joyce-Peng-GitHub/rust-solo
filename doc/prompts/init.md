Use TypeScript to develop a VS Code extension named as "Rust Solo" to help coding standalone Rust files. Maintain a "least recent used" cache of standalone files, whose max size can be configured by user and is 8 by default. When the LRU cache is not empty, add a `"rust_solo_cache.json"` to the `"rust-analyzer.linkedProjects"` in `settings.json`, and the cache json, which plays the role of a `rust-project.json`, should be stored in the `.vscode/` folder. Every time the user create or open a new `.rs` file, pop up a dialog to ask the user whether or not to add it to our LRU cache. If the LRU cache is full (already at max size), remove the least recent opened file from it and add the new one; however, if the number of opened `.rs` files is greater than the LRU cache size, we must include all of them until the user closes any one of them. Build the cache json according to the format of `rust-project.json`.
